# 370. Range Addition
# DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
# Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

# Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

# Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

# Example:

# Given:

#     length = 5,
#     updates = [
#         [1,  3,  2],
#         [2,  4,  3],
#         [0,  2, -2]
#     ]

# Output:

#     [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
# Explanation:

# Initial state:
# [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

# After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
# [ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]

# After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
# [ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]

# After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
# [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]
